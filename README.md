# process_handle
A cross platform wrapper around system native handles that allows copying and RAII based leak freedom.

## installation
the library is headers only so copying it into your project directory and including it is enough.

## quick reference
Default constructed process_handle is a handle to our own process.
It is also possible to construct process_handle using a process id
or an already existing handle.
It is safe to inherit from process_handle because it has protected destructor.
```c++
#include "process_handle.hpp"

jm::process_handle h;
h.owner_id(); // will be our own process id
h.native(); // returns the OS specific native handle
// also defines implicit conversion operator to native handle type
jm::native_handle_t native_handle = h; 
if(h) // conversion operator to bool
	h.reset(); // invalidates the handle stored in h
```
